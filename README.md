# steem-menu

Steem is much bigger than Steemit! Steem has so much to offer, so here's a menu of useful stuff to try out.

The Steem Menu extension is geared towards new Steemians. It helps with discovery and quick reference for the many web apps outside of Steemit. It is a collection of shortcuts to useful Steem blockchain web apps. As the explosion of Steem blockchain app development continues, new apps will be added to the menu.

The Steem Menu includes several apps which require authentication. This extension pairs well with the Steem Keychain extension.
